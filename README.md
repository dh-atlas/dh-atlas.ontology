The **ATLAS Ontology** is an OWL 2 DL ontology designed to effectively represent scholarly research projects and their outcomes within the Cultural Heritage domain. It highlights key characteristics of significant types of research products, including **Text Collection**, **Digital Scholarly Edition**, **Linked Open Data**, **Ontology**, and **Software**.
