## The Ontology

The **ATLAS Ontology** is an OWL 2 DL ontology designed to effectively represent scholarly research projects and their outcomes within the Cultural Heritage domain. It highlights key characteristics of significant types of research products, including **Text Collection**, **Digital Scholarly Edition**, **Linked Open Data**, **Ontology**, and **Software**. By capturing their unique attributes, ATLAS aims to promote good practices, sharing protocols, guidelines, and evaluation frameworks within the humanities.

## The Knowledge Graph

The **ATLAS Ontology** has been implemented to describe the metadata of selected pilot projects and their related entities. This effort has resulted in a Knowledge Graph, which is currently available as a compressed folder containing Turtle XML serializations. Additionally, some demo files have been curated to illustrate the structure of the main entities within this model. An alternative description of the research outcomes is also available in .csv format ([pilot analysis](https://github.com/dh-atlas/dh-atlas.github.io/tree/main/deliverables/pilot_analysis)).
